# Deep Learning Image Classification Model for Pneumonia Cases


Despite the availability of safe and effective antibiotics and vaccines for treatment and prevention, pneumonia is a leading cause of death worldwide and the leading infectious disease killer. This disease has a particularly high mortality rate especially amongst children of age 5 and younger. 

Most of the times it is crucial to effectively identify the first sympotms of pneumonia as early as possible in order to prevent the disease to worsen and eventually become reason for hospitalisation and even death. Deep learning algorithms and their computational power can be of help for medical staff when it comes to the interpretability and detection of possible signs of pneumonia in x-rays.

In this project, we have built a convolutional network trained on a dataset of 5,832 x-rays images collected by a number of hospitals in the region of Guangzhou. Although the dataset was relatively small and the CNN final structure used quite simple, the final model performance is very effective in identifying people affected by pneumonia with an overall accuracy and roc score respecively of xx and xx.
